As we approach the 2025 flu season, it's important to take proactive steps to protect yourself and your loved ones from influenza. The flu is more than just a bad cold—it can lead to serious complications, especially in vulnerable populations.

## Why Get Vaccinated?

The influenza vaccine is the most effective way to prevent the flu and its complications. Each year, the vaccine is updated to target the strains most likely to circulate during flu season. Even if you've been vaccinated in previous years, annual vaccination is essential as immunity wanes and virus strains change.

## Who Should Get the Flu Vaccine?

The Australian Government provides free flu vaccines for:
- Children aged 6 months to under 5 years
- People 65 years and over
- Pregnant women
- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people
- People with chronic medical conditions

However, we recommend flu vaccination for everyone over 6 months of age.

## When to Get Vaccinated

The optimal time for flu vaccination in Australia is April to May, before the flu season peaks. However, it's never too late to get vaccinated—protection can still be beneficial even during the flu season.

## Other Preventive Measures

Beyond vaccination, you can reduce your flu risk by:
- Washing hands frequently with soap and water
- Covering coughs and sneezes with your elbow
- Staying home when you're sick
- Maintaining a healthy lifestyle with good nutrition and adequate sleep
- Avoiding close contact with people who are ill

## What to Do If You Get the Flu

If you develop flu symptoms:
- Rest and drink plenty of fluids
- Take over-the-counter pain relievers for aches and fever
- Contact us if you're in a high-risk group or symptoms worsen
- Antiviral medications may be prescribed for certain patients if started early

Book your flu vaccination today at Gosnells Family Practice. Call (08) 6118 2788 or book online.

## Key Management Strategies

### For Diabetes
- Monitor blood glucose levels as recommended

"Prevention is better than cure" is more than just a saying—it's a fundamental principle of modern healthcare. Regular health check-ups are one of the most important things you can do to protect your long-term health and wellbeing.

## Why Regular Check-ups Matter

Many serious health conditions develop silently, with no obvious symptoms in their early stages. Conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and even some cancers can progress significantly before you notice any problems.

Regular check-ups allow us to:
- Detect health issues early when they're most treatable
- Establish baseline measurements for comparison
- Update your vaccinations
- Review your medications and health history
- Provide personalized health advice
- Screen for age-appropriate cancers and other conditions

## What Happens During a Health Check-up?

A comprehensive health check-up typically includes:

### Health History Review
- Current medications and supplements
- Family medical history
- Lifestyle factors (diet, exercise, alcohol, smoking)
- Any symptoms or concerns

### Physical Examination
- Blood pressure measurement
- Heart and lung examination
- Abdominal examination
- Skin check (particularly for skin cancer screening)
- Weight and BMI assessment

### Screening Tests (Based on Age and Risk Factors)
- Blood tests (cholesterol, blood glucose, kidney function, thyroid)
- Urine tests
- ECG (heart tracing) if indicated
- Cancer screenings:
  - Cervical screening (women 25-74 years)
  - Bowel cancer screening (50+ years)
  - Prostate checks (men 50+ or earlier if high risk)
  - Mammogram referral (women 50+ years)

## Recommended Check-up Frequency

### Ages 18-40
- Every 1-2 years if healthy
- More frequently if you have risk factors or chronic conditions

### Ages 40-65
- Annually recommended
- More frequent monitoring if you have chronic conditions

### Ages 65+
- At least annually, often more frequently
- Regular medication reviews
- Falls risk assessment
- Cognitive screening if concerns

## Health Checks for Specific Groups

### Women's Health
- Cervical screening every 5 years (ages 25-74)
- Breast screening mammogram every 2 years (ages 50-74)
- Bone density scan if at risk of osteoporosis
- Preconception health checks

### Men's Health
- Prostate cancer screening discussion from age 50 (or 40 if family history)
- Testicular self-examination education
- Cardiovascular risk assessment

### Chronic Condition Patients
- More frequent reviews (every 3-6 months typically)
- Condition-specific monitoring
- Medication reviews

## Making the Most of Your Check-up

To get the most from your health check-up:
- Book a longer appointment (30-40 minutes)
- Bring your current medications
- Write down questions or concerns beforehand
- Be honest about your lifestyle and symptoms
- Ask for clarification if you don't understand something
- Follow through with recommended tests and referrals

## Medicare-Funded Health Assessments

Medicare provides funding for comprehensive health assessments for:
- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (all ages)
- People aged 45-49 years (once only)
- People aged 75+ years (annually)
- People with intellectual disability

Good nutrition is the foundation of good health. Our accredited dietitians share their top evidence-based tips for building healthy eating habits that last.

## The Fundamentals of Healthy Eating

Forget fad diets and quick fixes. Sustainable healthy eating is about:
- Eating a variety of whole foods
- Balancing your plate with vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains
- Listening to your hunger and fullness cues
- Making gradual, sustainable changes
- Enjoying food without guilt

## Building Your Healthy Plate

Use the Australian Dietary Guidelines as your foundation:
- **½ plate**: vegetables and legumes (aim for variety and color)
- **¼ plate**: lean protein (meat, fish, eggs, tofu, legumes)
- **¼ plate**: whole grains (brown rice, quinoa, whole grain bread)
- **Side**: fruit and dairy or alternatives

## Nutrition Tips for Common Health Goals

### For Weight Management
- Focus on whole, minimally processed foods
- Include protein at each meal to support satiety
- Fill up on fiber from vegetables, fruits, and whole grains
- Stay hydrated—sometimes thirst masquerades as hunger
- Practice mindful eating without distractions
- Don't skip meals, especially breakfast

### For Diabetes Management
- Choose low GI (glycemic index) carbohydrates
- Pair carbs with protein or healthy fats to stabilize blood sugar
- Include fiber-rich foods to slow glucose absorption
- Eat regular, consistent meals
- Monitor portion sizes of carbohydrate foods
- Work with our dietitians for personalized meal planning

### For Heart Health
- Choose unsaturated fats (olive oil, avocado, nuts, fish)
- Limit saturated fats (fatty meats, full-fat dairy, processed foods)
- Increase omega-3 intake (salmon, sardines, walnuts, flaxseeds)
- Reduce sodium by cooking from scratch
- Eat plenty of fiber from oats, legumes, fruits, and vegetables

### For Digestive Health
- Gradually increase fiber intake
- Stay well-hydrated
- Include probiotic foods (yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut)
- Eat regular meals
- Identify and avoid trigger foods if you have IBS or intolerances

## Practical Tips for Healthy Eating

### Meal Planning
- Plan meals for the week ahead
- Shop with a list to avoid impulse buys
- Prep ingredients in advance (wash and chop vegetables, cook grains)
- Batch cook and freeze portions for busy days

### Smart Snacking
- Keep healthy snacks visible and accessible
- Pair carbs with protein (apple with nut butter, crackers with cheese)
- Prepare snack portions in advance
- Choose whole foods over packaged snacks

### Eating Out
- Check menus online before going
- Choose grilled, steamed, or baked over fried
- Ask for dressings and sauces on the side
- Fill up on vegetables
- Share desserts or skip them altogether

## Reading Food Labels

Learn to identify:
- Serving sizes (often smaller than you think!)
- Total sugar content (aim for <15g per 100g)
- Sodium levels (aim for <400mg per 100g)
- Fiber content (aim for >3g per serving)
- The ingredient list (fewer ingredients is usually better)

## Hydration Matters

- Aim for 2-3 liters of water daily
- More if you're active or in hot weather
- Limit sugary drinks and excessive caffeine
- Herbal teas count toward your fluid intake

## When to Seek Professional Help

Consider booking with our dietitians if you:
- Have a chronic health condition requiring dietary management
- Need help with weight management
- Have digestive issues or food intolerances
- Are pregnant or breastfeeding
- Want personalized nutrition advice for your goals

Remember, healthy eating isn't about perfection—it's about making better choices most of the time. Small, consistent changes add up to significant health benefits over time.

    excerpt: 'Australia has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world. Learn about the importance of regular skin checks and what to expect during screening.',

Australia has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world, with two in three Australians diagnosed with skin cancer by age 70. The good news? When detected early, most skin cancers are highly treatable.

## Understanding Skin Cancer

There are three main types of skin cancer:

### Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)
- Most common type
- Grows slowly and rarely spreads
- Appears as a pearly or waxy bump, or a flat, flesh-colored lesion
- Highly treatable when caught early

### Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)
- Second most common
- Can spread if left untreated
- Appears as a firm, red nodule or a flat lesion with a scaly, crusted surface
- Requires prompt treatment

### Melanoma
- Most dangerous type
- Can spread rapidly to other parts of the body
- Appears as a new spot or a change in an existing mole
- Early detection is critical for successful treatment

## Who Should Get Screened?

Everyone should perform regular self-examinations, but professional skin checks are especially important for those with:
- Fair skin that burns easily
- History of sunburns, especially in childhood
- Many moles (more than 50)
- Family history of skin cancer
- Previous skin cancer diagnosis
- Occupational sun exposure
- Weakened immune system

## What Happens During a Skin Check?

### Full Body Examination
- Our qualified doctor will examine your entire skin surface
- This includes scalp, between toes, soles of feet, and other easily missed areas
- You'll need to undress to your underwear (gowns provided for modesty)

### Dermoscopy
- A specialized magnifying device examines suspicious spots
- Allows detailed examination of skin structures
- Helps differentiate between benign and potentially malignant lesions

### Photography
- Baseline photos may be taken of concerning lesions
- Allows comparison at future visits to monitor changes

### Treatment Planning
- If a concerning lesion is found, treatment options will be discussed
- May include biopsy, excision, or referral to a dermatologist
- Most procedures can be done in our practice

## The ABCDE Rule for Melanoma Detection

Learn to identify warning signs:
- **A - Asymmetry**: One half doesn't match the other
- **B - Border**: Irregular, scalloped, or poorly defined edges
- **C - Color**: Varied colors including tan, brown, black, red, white, or blue
- **D - Diameter**: Larger than 6mm (size of a pencil eraser)
- **E - Evolving**: Changing in size, shape, color, or symptoms

## How Often Should You Get Checked?

### High Risk
- Every 6-12 months if you have multiple risk factors
- More frequent monitoring if you have a history of skin cancer

### Moderate Risk
- Annually for most people

### Low Risk
- Every 1-2 years if you have few risk factors

Always book an urgent appointment if you notice a new or changing spot.

## Prevention is Key

While screening is crucial, prevention is your first line of defense:
- Apply SPF 50+ sunscreen daily, even in winter
- Reapply every 2 hours or after swimming/sweating
- Wear protective clothing, including a broad-brimmed hat
- Seek shade, especially between 10 AM and 4 PM
- Avoid tanning beds entirely
- Protect children's skin from a young age

## What if Something is Found?

Don't panic. Most skin lesions are benign. If treatment is needed:
- Many skin cancers can be treated with simple excision
- Procedures are performed under local anesthetic
- Most patients experience excellent outcomes with early detection
- Follow-up monitoring will be scheduled

## Medicare Rebates

Skin cancer screening consultations are eligible for Medicare rebates. If you're in a high-risk category or have concerning symptoms, the consultation may be bulk billed.

## Book Your Skin Check Today

Don't wait until you notice a problem. Early detection saves lives. Our experienced doctors provide thorough screening and expert care.

Call (08) 6118 2788 or book online to schedule your skin check.
